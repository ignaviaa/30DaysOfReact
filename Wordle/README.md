# WORDLE

It is a web app based on a word game that involves guessing of five-letter words with six attempts. On each attempt, a feedback will be given for each guess in the form of coloured tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.

The basic rules of it is:

-The player has to guess the Wordle in six attempts or less
-Every word, which is entered should be in the word list
-If the letter is correct, the color would turn green
-If the letter is correct but placed wrong then it would turn yellow
-An incorrect letter turns gray
-Letters can be used more than one time
